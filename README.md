Permalist is a simple task management web application built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The backend uses PostgreSQL to store and manage tasks, allowing users to add, edit, and delete items. All database operations are performed using secure, parameterized SQL queries via the pg library. The frontend is rendered using EJS templates, providing dynamic and responsive views for the user. This project demonstrates how to combine Express routing, EJS templating, and SQL-based data persistence to create a full-stack web app with robust CRUD functionality.
